# Image Analysis Framework 

## Overview
This framework provides a comprehensive, deeply detailed dimensional analysis system for high‑fidelity image understanding.  
It evolves from the original 12‑dimension model and expands each dimension with:
- Extensive keyword libraries  
- Sub‑categories  
- Analysis methods  
- Prompt‑ready extraction guidelines  
- Safety and compliance notes  

A 14th dimension (Rendering & Digital Artifacts) is included to support modern AI and CGI workflows.
